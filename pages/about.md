I am a data scientist and research engineer with experience primarily in machine learning for audio (music and speech). I started my career in the recording industry, gaining experience through producing sessions for voice-over artists, film post-production teams, and musicians. I have recently finished my masters in Audio Engineering at the University of Derby with a focus on automatic speech recognition systems and audio DSP. I am following my interests in the data science and research field in order to continue my pursuits in ASR and machine learning. Currently, I am a student at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in NYC.

I love history audiobooks, Star Wars, and games, particularly board games!
