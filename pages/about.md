I am a data scientist and research engineer experienced with many machine learning techniques ranging from classification algorithms and automatic modelers to machine learning for audio (music and speech). Although I started my career in the recording industry, gaining experience through producing sessions for voice-over artists, film post-production teams, and musicians, I recently finished my masters in Audio Engineering at the University of Derby with a particular focus on automatic speech recognition systems. I am currently advancing my skills in data science in order to pursue my interests in ASR and machine learning and I have just graduated from the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in NYC. 

I love history audiobooks, Star Wars, and games, particularly board games!
