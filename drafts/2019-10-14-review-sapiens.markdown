## Strong on Anthropological History, Weak on Philosophy

* religion 
    * focus on christianity
    * lack of jewish history with rome
    * little time spent on islam, a lot on buddhism
    * ideologies as religion
        * lacks spiritual analysis beyond just belief system
* chapter 6 existential nihilism
* strong early history of sapiens
    * to much time spent on modern times
