## A Multiple Choice Movie with Multiple Choice Responses

This year's much talked about movie release, [Joker (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286456/) has largely stirred up
an incredible rift in audience responses.  Some have accused it of supporting "incel" culture, something that I honestly 
had not been aware of until I had conducted a brief Google search.  Other do not quite grasp the purpose of the film, recoiling
at its liberal use of violence and insanity and the conspicuous absence of a central overlying message.  I, however, found 
the film to be the most accurate depiction of the original comic book villain to be committed to film yet.
