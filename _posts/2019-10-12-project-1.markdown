# What are the best predictors for interest in a book on Goodreads?

[Goodreads.com](http://goodreads.com) is essentially a social networking website for book lovers; the site introduces 
a slew of new social interactions related to reading books.  But how many of them are pertinent to the average 
Goodreads user?  In order to answer this question, I decided to explore the use of a linear regression model to 
predict the total number of people that would want to read a book on Goodreads.  Thankfully, Goodreads tracks an 
insightful statistic called "to-read," which records the number of users that indicate their desire to read a book on a 
book's Goodreads page.

## Web Scraping Using BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium

In order to create a dataset of books and their attributes I chose to use the BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium packages in 
Python3.  There were several key features that I chose to collect from Goodreads' book pages.  They included a number of
different attributes such as the number of followers an author had, representing their popularity, to categorical features
such as book genre and binding.  I collected the number of trivia questions and "likes" that a quote from the book had 
as well as the amazon adn kindle prices if available.  While most of the html information I was looking for could easily 
be scraped using BeautifulSoup4, there were some specific interactions that required Selenium, such as the ability to 
click the link to a book's Amazon page to scrape the price or logging in to access the special book stats section of a
Goodreads page.
