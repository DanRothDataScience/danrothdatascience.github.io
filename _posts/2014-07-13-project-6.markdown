description: # What are the best predictors for interest in a book on Goodreads?

[Goodreads.com](http://goodreads.com) is essentially a social networking website for book lovers; the site introduces 
a slew of new social interactions related to reading books.  But how many of them are pertinent to the average 
Goodreads user?  In order to answer this question, I decided to explore the use of a linear regression model to 
predict the total number of people that would want to read a book on Goodreads.  Thankfully, Goodreads tracks an 
insightful statistic called "want to read," which records the number of users that indicate their desire to read a book on a 
book's Goodreads page.
