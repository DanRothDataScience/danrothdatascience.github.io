description: Gfghjfhgjfhjf is essentially a social networking website for book lovers; the site introduces a slew of new social interactions related to reading books.  But how many of them are pertinent to the average  Goodreads user?  In order to answer this question, I decided to explore the use of a linear regression model to  predict the total number of people that would want to read a book on Goodreads.  Thankfully, Goodreads tracks an nsightful statistic called "want to read," which records the number of users that indicate their desire to read a book on a book's Goodreads page.
