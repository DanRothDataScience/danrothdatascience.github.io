Data scientists are often tasked with working through massive data stores to provide workable insights.  These insights 
are then analyzed in order to identify patterns related to business intelligence or even human behavior.  However, it 
may be one thing to construct data queries and machine learning pipelines, employing all types of optimizations and 
clever algorithms.  It is entirely another thing to be able to communicate the results of arduous data collection and 
modeling to colleagues that do not share an intimate knowledge of data processing.  This is where data visualization 
arrives to save the day.

In his book &quot;Good Charts,&quot; Scott Berinato exclaims: &quot;_A good visualization can communicate the nature and 
potential impact of information and ideas more powerfully than any other form of communication_.&quot;  Many of us are 
familiar with the saying: &quot;_A picture is worth a thousand words._&quot; Similarly, in Data Science, effective 
visualizations that offer striking evidence of strong seasonal patterns, sharp trends related to a successful marketing 
campaign, or prominent outliers that need to be addressed are incredibly important.  Visualization for small data sets 
is easy and highly beneficial, but it can be nearly impossible for large data sets with hundreds if not thousands of 
variables where we have to decide on what the best insights are to highlight out of a dataset.  On top of this, data 
scientists must often use non-standardized visualization libraries that require quite a bit of coding to get visuals 
with the right kind of impact.  Thankfully, there is an alternative to creating visualizations using this brute force 
approach.  I recently learned about a library called AutoViz (which is short for &quot;Automated Visualization&quot;) 
during a presentation given by its designer and author.

## AutoViz: An Introduction

AutoViz addresses many of the aforementioned challenges that can arise when performing data visualization work.  The tool 
can be called using a single line of code by feeding it either a pandas dataframe object or a raw csv file to import.  
If the number of observations is large, AutoViz will take a random sample; likewise if the number of variables is large 
(which you can decide) AutoViz  can find the most important features and plot impactful visualizations only using those 
automatically selected features.  The user can set the sample number of rows and the maximum number of features to 
visualize by simply passing a parameter to AutoViz.  AutoViz is capable of adapting to any number of different data 
contexts such as regression, classification, or even time-series data.  It also delivers output incredibly quickly.

AutoViz can be implemented in 4 simple steps:

1. Install using &quot;pip install autoviz&quot;
2. Import with "from autoviz.AutoViz_Class import AutoViz_Class"
3. Instantiate a class "AV = AutoViz_Class()"
4. Run an experiment in the following line with our data set:
```python
dft = AV.AutoViz("filename", sep="sep", depVar="target", dfte="pandasDF", header=0, verbose=2, lowess=False, chart_format="svg", max_rows_analyzed=1500, max_cols_analyzed=30)
```

## Advantages of AutoViz

There are many advantages to approaching visualization using AutoViz.  The library is very interpretable and can be set 
to a highly verbose mode using the verbose=1 or 2 flag.  An XGBoost model is repeatedly used to determine the most 
consistent set of features determined to be important by using a random set of features each time; the most prominent 
selected features can then serve to guide future plotting and visualization. This sounds like it may take time, but in 
reality, it gets done very fast. To do this effectively, AutoViz classifies the selected variables as categorical, 
numerical, boolean, NLP text and so on in order to understand how to best plot them.  Finally, using in-built heuristics, 
the tool will return the visuals deemed to have the greatest impact.  AutoViz is also very much systematic: it uses all 
the selected variables with different chart types in order to deliver the best insights by letting the charts speak for 
themselves.  Subjective domain knowledge can often bias even a highly experienced data scientist into selecting only a 
handful of charts to highlight insights from a data set.  AutoViz&#39; objective selection of features and plots can 
point data teams towards the best approaches using a systematic methodology and can greatly enhance a team&#39;s 
productivity from the very outset of a project.

What does AutoViz look like in practice?  Of course, the only way to understand a visualization library is to observe 
some of its plots.

## Data Set: Online Shoppers&#39; Intention

Let&#39;s take the online shopper&#39;s intention dataset from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/online-shoppers-intention](https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/online-shoppers-intention)).
   The data consists of around 12,000 observations of different online shoppers over the course of a year.  This is a 
   classification task; we are trying to predict whether or not the online shopper will actually purchase an item or is 
   just &quot;window shopping&quot; based on the feature set.  AutoViz is able to confirm that all 17 of the features 
   have useful information for predicting the target variable.

All the charts below are from selected from the 100&#39;s that AutoViz provides. First, there is a bar plot representing
 the percentage of observations that make up our target class.

It becomes immediately apparent that we are dealing with class imbalance in the data as the desired class value 
(&quot;True&quot;) consists of only 15% of the total dataset. Next we can see how individual variables may need some 
&quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;transformation&quot; as AutoViz provides KDE Plots of each numerical variable.

We can see from above that all four variables are right skewed and may need to be &quot;log-transformed&quot; in order 
to be used in a Linear model. These kinds of charts will prove to be very useful when building a data pipeline for 
modeling for the problem later.

Visualizations can provide very strong evidence of interactions between different variables. You can see from the 
following chart that bounce rates and exit rates at high levels can be good indicators of revenue leakage. They indicate 
that there will be no revenue in those transactions. Quick insights, if you know how to read the &quot;tea leaves&quot; 
as they say!

We can dive deeper into timing ecommerce purchases by examining a normalized histogram of online shopping purchases and 
their distance to a special day, or holiday, like Valentine&#39;s Day or Christmas.

 ![](../assets/img/posts/autoviz/shop_special.png)

The greatest spike in activity occurs about a week before a special day; despite the fact that our classes are 
imbalanced, about 50% of visitors will purchase an item in this time window.  This is a critical tipoff for when a 
business may want to run a promotion or target potential customers.

## Data set: Goodreads API

AutoViz is also able to deliver informative visuals of a dataset of around 12,000 books scraped using the Goodreads API.
  The dataset contains overall book metadata and the target variable is the &quot;average rating&quot; of the book, 
  which translates to a regression analysis.  This time, the library drops a few variables from the dataset such as the 
  ISBN and book titles, which do not offer much predictive information other than identification.  Interestingly, it 
  drops the author feature, which is something we may typically assume to be associated with a book&#39;s success.  
  However, since this is a categorical string variable in this dataset, there may not be enough evidence for using the 
  wide variety of authors names as a feature.

There is a correlation heatmap output by AutoViz that indicates that most of the variables are not highly correlated, 
with the exception of an obvious relationship between the number of ratings and number of written reviews.  Interestingly 
enough, there is some positive correlation between the number of pages and the review score.

  ![](../assets/img/posts/autoviz/books_heat.png)

There is more information that can be extracted in regards to a book&#39;s number of pages by analyzing the following 
scatter plot:

 ![](../assets/img/posts/autoviz/books_scatter.png)

Books with a greater number of pages tend to have an average rating of 4 and above.  However, it is worth noting that 
shorter length books (100-250 pages) are capable of receiving average review scores as high as 5 out of 5.  These may 
represent outliers however and it would be wise to further examine these highly rated books to make sure they have the 
same number of review scores as other entries.  Overall, this gives the impression that a publisher might want to set 
1250-1500 pages as a target number of pages for a book to perform well.

This information can be compounded with the knowledge that the number of pages in a book on Goodreads is normally 
distributed with a right-skew, as many books have around 400-500 pages.

 ![](../assets/img/posts/autoviz/books_pages.png)

We can then compare the distribution of the number of pages in a book to the distributions of the other variables present 
in the set using a violin plot output by AutoViz.

 ![](../assets/img/posts/autoviz/books_violin.png)

Average book ratings are also normally distributed, although left-skewed instead. Negative ratings are likely to be the 
significant outliers in the distribution.  It can also be observed that the number of ratings on a book look incredibly 
right-skewed; a small population of the books may receive an inordinate amount of the total ratings.

## Data Set: AirBnB Listing Data

AutoViz is then able to adeptly visualize AirBnB listing data, provided by a dataset of 20,000 listings located in 
Madrid, Spain.  The database is part of a relational collection of AirBnB data hosted on 
[Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/rusiano/madrid-airbnb-data](https://www.kaggle.com/rusiano/madrid-airbnb-data)) and 
includes attributes such as number of beds and bathrooms per listing, reviews, and calendar bookings.  For this 
experiment, the target variable is the review score for an AirBnB listing.  There are numerous features that are 
associated with each entry, which is intimidating at first glance.  Thankfully, AutoViz finds many low-information 
variables that can be excluded in order to reduce the variance of the data.  Some of the excluded features are 
surprising, such as the price, square footage, or neighborhood of a listing.

The automatically generated plots are very informative about some of the aspects of the different listings.  For example,
 it may be surprising to learn that a vast majority of AirBnB hosts respond within an hour of being contacted.
 
 ![](../assets/img/posts/autoviz/bnb_resp.png)

It is also common for a host to offer their entire living space as part of the listing, although about half the time the 
listing may only be offering a single room on the premises.  However, this makes sense once it is corroborated with the 
fact that a large amount of the listings are for an apartment rather than a house in Madrid.

 ![](../assets/img/posts/autoviz/bnb_space.png)

 ![](../assets/img/posts/autoviz/bnb_home.png)

What about the predictive factors for our target variable?  An analysis of the heatmap that AutoViz generates indicates 
that the most highly correlated feature to a listing&#39;s review rating is the number of reviews received per month.  
Many AirBnB reviews are likely to be positive, so this could imply that it is best for an AirBnB member to host as many 
guests as possible and to incentivize them to leave reviews as this could most efficiently improve the listing&#39;s 
review score over time.

 <img src="../assets/img/posts/autoviz/bnb_heat.png">

There is a single negatively correlated feature to the listing review score, and that is the number of listings an AirBnB
 host maintains.  Listings may perform better when they receive more personalized attention from a host rather than being
  part of an allotment of different accommodations.

## Conclusion

While these are only a sampling of the plots that AutoViz generates, it is not hard to see how helpful automated 
visualization can be.  Within moments, the library is capable of generating highly informational plots and provides 
many pathways of potential expansion for a data scientist&#39;s modeling or analysis pipeline.  AutoViz is meant to be 
integrated within a systematic iterative process.  Exploratory data analysis (EDA) can be effectively initiated with 
AutoViz; features can be selected based on the tool&#39;s analysis and then the data can be repeatedly processed for 
automatic visualization.  Once strong visualizations are generated, a data scientist can now jump into modeling or 
communicating the data with a well informed analysis.  It is surprising that automated visualization options are so 
sparse given its many conceivable uses as an objective and practical tool, but AutoViz thankfully fulfills this role to 
great effect.  Now let&#39;s get some visualizations going!
